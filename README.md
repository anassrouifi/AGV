## Description

The AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) robot project focuses on automating and optimizing the component distribution process within the automotive wiring company. This robot collects information from barcode labels on boxes, makes decisions to route components to the appropriate sections, and autonomously navigates to these destinations.

The key objectives of the AGV robot project include:

- **Distribution Optimization:** Accelerating and optimizing the component distribution process within the automotive wiring company to reduce production lead times through automation.

- **Error Reduction:** Minimizing human errors often associated with manual component distribution. The AGV robot ensures precision and consistency in component distribution.

- **Enhanced Traceability:** By scanning barcode labels and recording information in a centralized database, the AGV robot enhances component traceability throughout the production process.

- **Factory Coordination:** Determining component destinations based on barcode information, the AGV robot facilitates coordination between different segments of KenA and KenB factories.

- **Overall Efficiency:** Automating component distribution leads to a global increase in production efficiency, reducing delays and optimizing resources.

By addressing these critical aspects, the AGV robot development project is poised to achieve its goals with clarity and precision while delivering significant benefits to stakeholders in the automotive wiring company.


## Mechanical Design with CATIA

The mechanical design for this AGV robot project was created using CATIA, a powerful computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software. CATIA was chosen for its robust capabilities in modeling, simulation, and analysis, making it an ideal tool for designing complex mechanical systems like the AGV robot.

### CATIA Features Utilized

- **3D Modeling:** CATIA was used to create detailed 3D models of the AGV robot's components, including its chassis, wheels, sensors, and other mechanical parts.

- **Assembly Design:** CATIA's assembly design features were employed to assemble the individual components into a coherent and functional AGV robot model.

- **Simulation and Analysis:** The software's simulation and analysis tools were instrumental in evaluating the robot's structural integrity, motion dynamics, and performance under different conditions.

- **Rendering:** CATIA's rendering capabilities helped in creating realistic visual representations of the AGV robot, aiding in design visualization and presentation.

### How to Access the CATIA Design Files

The CATIA design files, including the 3D models and assembly files, can be found in the "CAD-Design" directory of this repository. You can use CATIA or a compatible software to open and explore these files.
