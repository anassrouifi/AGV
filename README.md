## Description

The AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) robot project focuses on automating and optimizing the component distribution process within the automotive wiring company. This robot collects information from barcode labels on boxes, makes decisions to route components to the appropriate sections, and autonomously navigates to these destinations.

The key objectives of the AGV robot project include:

- **Distribution Optimization:** Accelerating and optimizing the component distribution process within the automotive wiring company to reduce production lead times through automation.

- **Error Reduction:** Minimizing human errors often associated with manual component distribution. The AGV robot ensures precision and consistency in component distribution.

- **Enhanced Traceability:** By scanning barcode labels and recording information in a centralized database, the AGV robot enhances component traceability throughout the production process.

- **Factory Coordination:** Determining component destinations based on barcode information, the AGV robot facilitates coordination between different segments of KenA and KenB factories.

- **Overall Efficiency:** Automating component distribution leads to a global increase in production efficiency, reducing delays and optimizing resources.

By addressing these critical aspects, the AGV robot development project is poised to achieve its goals with clarity and precision while delivering significant benefits to stakeholders in the automotive wiring company.
